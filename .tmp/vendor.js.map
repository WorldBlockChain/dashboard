For example, even if other promises given to the\r\n  `promises` array argument are resolved, but the first settled promise has\r\n  become rejected before the other promises became fulfilled, the returned\r\n  promise will become rejected:\r\n\r\n  ```javascript\r\n  let promise1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\r\n    setTimeout(function(){\r\n      resolve('promise 1');\r\n    }, 200);\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  let promise2 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\r\n    setTimeout(function(){\r\n      reject(new Error('promise 2'));\r\n    }, 100);\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function(result){\r\n    // Code here never runs\r\n  }, function(reason){\r\n    // reason.message === 'promise 2' because promise 2 became rejected before\r\n    // promise 1 became fulfilled\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  An example real-world use case is implementing timeouts:\r\n\r\n  ```javascript\r\n  Promise.race([ajax('foo.json'), timeout(5000)])\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  @method race\r\n  @static\r\n  @param {Array} promises array of promises to observe\r\n  Useful for tooling.\r\n  @return {Promise} a promise which settles in the same way as the first passed\r\n  promise to settle.\r\n*/\r\nfunction race(entries) {\r\n  /*jshint validthis:true */\r\n  var Constructor = this;\r\n\r\n  if (!isArray(entries)) {\r\n    return new Constructor(function (_, reject) {\r\n      return reject(new TypeError('You must pass an array to race.'));\r\n    });\r\n  } else {\r\n    return new Constructor(function (resolve, reject) {\r\n      var length = entries.length;\r\n      for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {\r\n        Constructor.resolve(entries[i]).then(resolve, reject);\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n  `Promise.reject` returns a promise rejected with the passed `reason`.\r\n  It is shorthand for the following:\r\n\r\n  ```javascript\r\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\r\n    reject(new Error('WHOOPS'));\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  promise.then(function(value){\r\n    // Code here doesn't run because the promise is rejected!\r\n  }, function(reason){\r\n    // reason.message === 'WHOOPS'\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Instead of writing the above, your code now simply becomes the following:\r\n\r\n  ```javascript\r\n  let promise = Promise.reject(new Error('WHOOPS'));\r\n\r\n  promise.then(function(value){\r\n    // Code here doesn't run because the promise is rejected!\r\n  }, function(reason){\r\n    // reason.message === 'WHOOPS'\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  @method reject\r\n  @static\r\n  @param {Any} reason value that the returned promise will be rejected with.\r\n  Useful for tooling.\r\n  @return {Promise} a promise rejected with the given `reason`.\r\n*/\r\nfunction reject(reason) {\r\n  /*jshint validthis:true */\r\n  var Constructor = this;\r\n  var promise = new Constructor(noop);\r\n  _reject(promise, reason);\r\n  return promise;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction needsResolver() {\r\n  throw new TypeError('You must pass a resolver function as the first argument to the promise constructor');\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction needsNew() {\r\n  throw new TypeError(\"Failed to construct 'Promise': Please use the 'new' operator, this object constructor cannot be called as a function.\");\r\n}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n  Promise objects represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The\r\n  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\r\n  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\r\n  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\r\n\r\n  Terminology\r\n  -----------\r\n\r\n  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\r\n  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\r\n  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\r\n  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\r\n  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\r\n  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\r\n\r\n  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\r\n\r\n  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\r\n  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\r\n  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\r\n\r\n  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\r\n  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\r\n  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\r\n  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\r\n  itself fulfill.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Basic Usage:\r\n  ------------\r\n\r\n  ```js\r\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\r\n    // on success\r\n    resolve(value);\r\n\r\n    // on failure\r\n    reject(reason);\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  promise.then(function(value) {\r\n    // on fulfillment\r\n  }, function(reason) {\r\n    // on rejection\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Advanced Usage:\r\n  ---------------\r\n\r\n  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\r\n  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\r\n\r\n  ```js\r\n  function getJSON(url) {\r\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\r\n      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\r\n\r\n      xhr.open('GET', url);\r\n      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\r\n      xhr.responseType = 'json';\r\n      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\r\n      xhr.send();\r\n\r\n      function handler() {\r\n        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\r\n          if (this.status === 200) {\r\n            resolve(this.response);\r\n          } else {\r\n            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      };\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\r\n    // on fulfillment\r\n  }, function(reason) {\r\n    // on rejection\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\r\n\r\n  ```js\r\n  Promise.all([\r\n    getJSON('/posts'),\r\n    getJSON('/comments')\r\n  ]).then(function(values){\r\n    values[0] // => postsJSON\r\n    values[1] // => commentsJSON\r\n\r\n    return values;\r\n  });\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  @class Promise\r\n  @param {function} resolver\r\n  Useful for tooling.\r\n  @constructor\r\n*/\r\nfunction Promise(resolver) {\r\n  this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\r\n  this._result = this._state = undefined;\r\n  this._subscribers = [];\r\n\r\n  if (noop !== resolver) {\r\n    typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\r\n    this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nPromise.all = all;\r\nPromise.race = race;\r\nPromise.resolve = resolve;\r\nPromise.reject = reject;\r\nPromise._setScheduler = setScheduler;\r\nPromise._setAsap = setAsap;\r\nPromise._asap = asap;\r\n\r\nPromise.prototype = {\r\n  constructor: Promise,\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n    The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\r\n    which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\r\n    reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\r\n  \r\n    ```js\r\n    findUser().then(function(user){\r\n      // user is available\r\n    }, function(reason){\r\n      // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\r\n    });\r\n    ```\r\n  \r\n    Chaining\r\n    --------\r\n  \r\n    The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\r\n    promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\r\n    or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\r\n  \r\n    ```js\r\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\r\n      return user.name;\r\n    }, function (reason) {\r\n      return 'default name';\r\n    }).then(function (userName) {\r\n      // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\r\n      // will be `'default name'`\r\n    });\r\n  \r\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\r\n      throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\r\n    }, function (reason) {\r\n      throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\r\n    }).then(function (value) {\r\n      // never reached\r\n    }, function (reason) {\r\n      // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\r\n      // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\r\n    });\r\n    ```\r\n    If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\r\n  \r\n    ```js\r\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\r\n      throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\r\n    }).then(function (value) {\r\n      // never reached\r\n    }).then(function (value) {\r\n      // never reached\r\n    }, function (reason) {\r\n      // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\r\n    });\r\n    ```\r\n  \r\n    Assimilation\r\n    ------------\r\n  \r\n    Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\r\n    retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\r\n    fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\r\n    until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\r\n  \r\n    ```js\r\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\r\n      return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\r\n    }).then(function (comments) {\r\n      // The user's comments are now available\r\n    });\r\n    ```\r\n  \r\n    If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\r\n  \r\n    ```js\r\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\r\n      return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\r\n    }).then(function (comments) {\r\n      // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\r\n    }, function (reason) {\r\n      // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\r\n    });\r\n    ```\r\n  \r\n    Simple Example\r\n    --------------\r\n  \r\n    Synchronous Example\r\n  \r\n

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\r\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\r\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\r\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\r\n//\r\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\r\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\r\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\r\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\r\n//\r\n// Here's how this works:\r\n//\r\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\r\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\r\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\r\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\r\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\r\n//\r\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\r\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\r\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\r\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\r\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\r\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\r\n//\r\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\r\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\r\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\r\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\r\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\r\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\r\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\r\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\r\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\r\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\r\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\r\n//\r\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\r\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\r\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\r\n\r\n'use strict';\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = Transform;\r\n\r\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\r\n\r\n/*<replacement>*/\r\nvar util = Object.create(require('core-util-is'));\r\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\r\n/*</replacement>*/\r\n\r\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\r\n\r\nfunction afterTransform(er, data) {\r\n  var ts = this._transformState;\r\n  ts.transforming = false;\r\n\r\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\r\n\r\n  if (!cb) {\r\n    return this.emit('error', new Error('write callback called multiple times'));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ts.writechunk = null;\r\n  ts.writecb = null;\r\n\r\n  if (data != null) // single equals check for both `null` and `undefined`\r\n    this.push(data);\r\n\r\n  cb(er);\r\n\r\n  var rs = this._readableState;\r\n  rs.reading = false;\r\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\r\n    this._read(rs.highWaterMark);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction Transform(options) {\r\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\r\n\r\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\r\n\r\n  this._transformState = {\r\n    afterTransform: afterTransform.bind(this),\r\n    needTransform: false,\r\n    transforming: false,\r\n    writecb: null,\r\n    writechunk: null,\r\n    writeencoding: null\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\r\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\r\n\r\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\r\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\r\n  // sync guard flag.\r\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\r\n\r\n  if (options) {\r\n    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\r\n\r\n    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\r\n  this.on('prefinish', prefinish);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction prefinish() {\r\n  var _this = this;\r\n\r\n  if (typeof this._flush === 'function') {\r\n    this._flush(function (er, data) {\r\n      done(_this, er, data);\r\n    });\r\n  } else {\r\n    done(this, null, null);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\r\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\r\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\r\n};\r\n\r\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\r\n// override this function in implementation classes.\r\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\r\n//\r\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\r\n// to the readable side.

Shortcut\r\n     * fusion is an optimization strategy which merge iteratee calls; this can help\r\n     * to avoid the creation of intermediate data structures and greatly reduce the\r\n     * number of iteratee executions.\r\n     *\r\n     * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `_#value` method is\r\n     * directly or indirectly included in the build.\r\n     *\r\n     * In
